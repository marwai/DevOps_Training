Agile
Agile began in mid 1990s. Derived that people are the people., who think they’re solving a problem when in reality they’re doing the wrong thing.
Now they are plenty of open source data, Youtube, SAM (steal and modify), use our own resources. 
In terms of agility, apple explained why 20 companies sent the best applications. The judges said they won the award because they looked at the design artefacts. The start and finish processes were profoundly different due to the iterative process.  The company made 37 pivots in 6months. Apple said the ability of the company to pivot. Pivot is dependant on the users/client. 
Amazon have a principle. Amazon allows for innovation, open grounds. Amazons method allows you to write a headline “we are pleased to release this for these customer/customers*”.  If headline has resonance, you can continue with your idea. 
He heavily supports agility. Sticking with the principles and belief helps companies and make change. Use standards of architectures, DM book of knowledge (BOK), PM BOK, final plug for the British Computer society, SFIA+. + stands for modification from BCA. It is a framework what you should be doing, capability maturity model increases from 1-4 and so on. 
His anecdote about patience, Oprah Winfrey. Years to get certification and even more to learn more, never truly master something. There will always someone that knows something that knows something that you don’t know. Bruce views cloud a disruption. AIG had £1 bil budget to develop their cloud. They failed. 
Make sure to backup. General Motors had a procurement for vehicles. They were downloading a widget, the output 
•	Enterprise Architect – has potential. IOT – edge computing, device computing
•	When a design is made, building is made. Sometimes engineer or builders couldn’t implement design due to limitations. Explored whether IOT can be used to redesign architecture 

Secure a job through your campaign by adding value. Translating to a function or capability refers to what value have you added to the company, helped the user. Attach to something that will make impact. Don’t be afraid if you’re part of new company, new project to explore new areas.
