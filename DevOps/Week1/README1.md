#   Starting GITHUB, demonstrated Team was really supportive, kept calm, persevered 
#   Instructor dealt with the situation well. Managed the class well, instructors’ actions and usually mirrored 
#   Went through couple examples of situational judgement and how to deal them appropriately, gave an insight of how others thought

Software development life cycle? - 
Waterfall? – Stage gate 
Agile?
V model? Validation & verification -  
Both Stage-Gate and Spiral process have their limitations.
The Systems Vee comes from the shape of the development model which looks like ‘V’.
In the software development world, there’s no such thing as one-size-fits-all solutions. Some models will work better in certain scenarios than they do in others. The SDLC, or software development life cycle, looks like this:
•	The process follows sequential as well as parallel flow of product development.
V model – aka verification and validation 
Considered extension of waterfall process, The V-model is a type of software development life cycle model where process executes in a sequential manner in V-Shape. During each step directly associated with the testing phase. It is used to produce rigorous development lifecycle models and project management models. 
When do we use them?
•	The V-shaped model should be used for small to medium sized projects where requirements are clearly defined and fixed. It is not considered an agile process
•	The V-Shaped model should be chosen when ample technical resources are available with needed technical expertise.
Verification Process 
•	verification is the process of checking that the software meets the specification
•	Confirm that the systems fulfil the design requirements.
•	“The product has been built right”
•	It is a measure of build.

Validation Process
•	To provide evidence that the service of the product/system complies with stakeholders’ requirements
•	Validation is the process of checking whether the specification captures the customer’s needs
•	It is a measure of performance.


•	At each stage of the integration, some form of integration testing will be conducted to verify the successful integration.

Pros	Cons
 Development and progress are very organized and systematic	-Not suitable for bigger and complex projects
Works well for smaller to medium sized projects.	Not suitable if the requirements are not consistent.
Testing starts from beginning so ambiguities are identified from the beginning.	No working software is produced in the intermediate stage.
Easy to manage as each phase has well defined objectives and goals.	No provision for doing risk analysis so uncertainty and risks are there.
