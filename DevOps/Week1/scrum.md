Sprint planning: A meeting that occurs at the beginning of a sprint, where the team looks at the product backlog and 
decides which items they want to work on throughout the sprint. The sprint itself starts as soon as the sprint planning 
has been completed and refers to the time period in which the team is working on the sprint backlog. Note that the
sprint cannot last longer than four weeks.

Daily scrum: This is a daily 10-15 minute meeting where the development team would plan what they aim to work on 
during the next 24hrs. It also informs everyone what is going on across the team

Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, the team presents the new features that have been introduced to the customer 
and receives feedback which will be useful for the next sprint.

Sprint Retrospective: An internal meeting where the team discusses the sprint and how they can improve the process 
for next time.
​
Product backlog: An ordered list of everything that would be needed to complete the product. This makes organisational 
priorities transparent for all internal stakeholders of the product.

A product owner is responsible for the product backlog. The product backlog is constantly evolving based on the 
information present at that particular moment in time. The product owner would collaborate with the development team 
to refine the product backlog (this would be done during the sprint review step).
 
Sprint backlog: This is just a small list of product backlog items that have been selected to be completed for the 
sprint, transparent real time picture of all of the work in the current sprint.

Product Increment: The sum of all completed product backlog items in a given sprint as well as the value of previous 
increments.
