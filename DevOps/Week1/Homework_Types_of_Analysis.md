Strategy Analysis

MOST
Mission, Objectives, Strategies, Tactics
When the daily activities that take up most of your time are no longer aligned with the vision that you have for the future of the business, you are going to have a hard time reaching your goals. Staying on track requires a close connection between long-term goals and short-term activities.
MOST organises the activities in support of each other so they are all heading in the same direction. Without this kind of cohesion between your activities, the future can unpredictable.

• Mission - What the organisation is about, what it is seeking to achieve
• Objectives - Goals against which the organisation achievements can be measured, through the organisation and use of Critical Success Factors and Key Performances (and targets)
• Strategy  - The approach the organisation will adopt to achieving it mission and objectives
• Tactics - The detailed ways in which the strategy will be implemented. The "tactics components of MOST is where the projects are identified and initiated. It is where the Agile BA begins the task of ensuring that the overall alignment with the strategy and objectives is maintained from Pre-Project though to Deployment and Benefits Assessment

	
Boston Box
Also known as the Growth-Share-Matrix is used to analyse portfolio of products. This categorises the products into one of four different areas, based on :
• Market share - does the product being sold have a low or high market share?
• Market growth - are the numbers of potential customers in the market growing or not



The four clusters indicate how valuable a product is now (market share) and in future (market growth). This, in turn, indicates a products ability to generate cash or their need for cash. Ultimately  cash generation is the ultimate measure of success for any product or business unit
• Dogs should be abandoned, of course.
• The best known strategy derived from the Boston box probably is that the cash generated from Cash Cows should be invested into the Question Marks in order to increase their relative market share.
	
Porters Five Forces 
This identifies the competitive forces within the organisation's marketplace by analysing five key competitive factors: Suppliers, Buyers (consumers), Competitors, New Entrants and Substitute Products.

For example, the prioritisation of extending technological support to customers and suppliers may produce a barrier to entry for other organisations wishing to enter the organisation's market. An Agile approach could deliver the prioritised features of support more quickly. 



PESTLE 
This analyses the factors affecting the organisation from the Political, Economic, Socio-cultural, Legal and Environmental perspectives. 
				
In, for example, a dynamic political situation, it may be possible for the BA to foresee the likelihood of taxation changes (political. In an Economical recovery, it may be competitively advantageous to recommend a more automated, rather than labour-intensive, model of technological support in order to be able to scale up quickly to handle increasing demand. 


SWOT
This is a simple but powerful means of pulling together key findings from the external and internal analysis. It is a summary of the organisation's current strategic position. 
• Strengths within the organisation that can be built upon 
• Weaknesses within the organisation that require action 
• Opportunities that could be exploited by the organisation 
• Threats that may be presented to the organisation
The SWOT Analysis can also be broken down into external and internal environment, with the Opportunities and Threats being external and the Strength and Weaknesses being internal 

	Stakeholder Analysis
Workshops
 A stakeholder workshop is one way to engage stakeholders – those who are affected by, have a direct interest in, or are somehow involved with the problem identified during the situation analysis. Workshops seek valued input from various people on the proposed program or to achieve consensus.

The attendees fall into three categories:
• Required attendees: The people who the meeting can’t go on without. If these people don’t show up, the meeting can’t be successful, and you end up with a lot of out-of-meeting tasks.
• Optional attendees: The meeting can still go on and be successful without these people. However, having them in the session can be helpful because they may bring valuable insight and opinions.
• Other people: These attendees may be new team members who have just joined the team and are there to listen to how the topic being discussed works. Perhaps you’re cross-training them or interfacing with them from another business domain.

The purpose of a workshop is to engage stakeholders for those interested or involved with the company. Workshops are useful:
• Validate situation analysis findings
• Fill information gaps identified during the situation analysis, program analysis or audience analysis
• Better understand the problem, audiences and context
• Begin to prioritise audiences, challenges to address and communication channels


Interviews
with stakeholders are one-to-one conversations about a specific topic or issue. The primary purpose of these interviews is to obtain project-relevant information and elicit stakeholder reactions and suggestions.

• Stakeholder interviews provide a broad overview of the interviewees’ opinions about a specific topic that may reveal hidden concerns or ideas that would not be expressed in response to a set number of specific questions.

Advantages
• Helps identify issues, concerns, and desired agendas
• Helps target potential participants
• Elicits ideas for designing a public participation process
• Provides a good way to introduce agency staff to the community
• Enhances an agency’s credibility because it demonstrates agency interest in the community and in understanding the community’s concerns

Disadvantages
• Can be expensive 
• Can be time consuming 
• Requires skilled interviewers 

Questionnaires
Stakeholder surveys are a questionnaire-based quantitative tool, most often used by projects or organisations to increase their understanding of the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, interests and experiences of their stakeholders – both internal and external. 
Benefits: 
• Findings are used to make improvements in the delivery of programmes and/or services.
• Stakeholder surveys can be very helpful in generating critical information required for performance management and for creating and sustaining organizational change.
