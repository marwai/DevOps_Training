Objectives
	• Understand database  terminology
	• Build an SQL database
	• Insert some common data into the database
	• List various database tools in commo use
	• Compare and explain the different database structure 
	• Explain a simple relational database structure 
	
	
	We must be able to structure tables to contain the right type of information, so that we can query it.
	
	Database sections attributes used in tables to label different data. Database allows us to group data into relevant information.

	First_name, last_name, money, money in total accounts, banking history
	
	Junction table is required to connected two values for many to many. Hence a table is one to many. 
	
	Type of database 
	Flat-file database 
	• Stores everything in one table. Good for small numbers of records related toa  single topic
	
	Relational database 
	• Gives you the ability to separate the masses of data into numerous tables
	• They are linked to each other through the use of keys
	
	Big data
	• MongoDB, Vertica etc.
	• Used for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence 
	• Digital Age and Internet of Things 
Relationships 

One-to-one relationship: occurs when there is a unique identifier to another unique identifier
One-to-many relationships: one customer can have numerous purchases, hence numerous purchase Ids  
Many-to-many relationships: Student can be assigned to a course and courses to multiple students
